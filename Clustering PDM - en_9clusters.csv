aljazeera can take this rohingya people on their studio and let them stay because they are weak and tired,6
indonesia has helped them alot before br but look what theyre doing now theyre invading us they came illegally more and more brought by unhcr backed up by amnesty international through their minions inside and outside indonesia no country will accept this rebellious people neither ours indonesia is a sovereign country our country our sovereignity we reject rohinya neither welcome nor give em any single piece of our land for them never ever our great grandparents fought and died for defending our country for us our children and future generation not for rohingya üáÆüá©ü¶Ö,3
as indian i agree to indonesian people these people come and settle in our country and spread violence under the name of religion,6
we would like to clarify that based on the republic of indonesia presidential decree reg no concerning handling of refugees from overseas as well as immigration law no of article paragraph article paragraphs and rohingya arrival and its method of arrival falls under the category of illegal immigrants and not refugees until proven otherwise simply put they arent under chase etc unlike what had happened to them in the past and fyi indonesia did not sign the ratification of the refugee convention so under international law so we have every right to refuse their arrival especially in recent cases they have been linked to an alleged people smuggling and human trafficking network recently there have been arrests regarding this they first arrived in then in they reportedly started causing serious security problems such as escaping from shelters in aceh etc as well as in the communities where they live in indonesia and malaysia because many of them were and are adult men and economically we simply cant afford it at the very least please interview both sides and not only unhcrs emily bojovic but also an indonesian expert on this phenomenon before publishing it to millions of viewers thank you on one of their recent arrivals in aceh the people on the boat threw food given by local residents into the sea because the local rejected their arrival rightfully so personally that doesnt sounds like what a refugee would do,6

pemerintah bangladesh telah mengakomodasi warga negara yang dideportasi dari myanmar ini mereka telah memberikan mereka kesempatan untuk tinggal dari sudut pandang kemanusiaan namun sejak datang ke sini orangorang rohingya ini telah terpecah menjadi beberapa kelompok dan terlibat dalam berbagai kejahatan dan sudah mulai melakukan kejahatan menyiksa warga bangladesh,1

you cant say rohingya are refugees because they came by the method of giving some payment to the human trafficking mafia in bangladesh these are all categorized under illegal immigrants of course as immigrants should not enter an area without clear data such as passports or visas so rohingya are precisely referred to as illegal immigrants on the other hand with palestine or afghanistan they are in a state of war raging please understand before creating a title so that your channel is not considered a channel that has no understanding in this matter,6
kami bersimpati kepada saudara sebangsa dan saudara muslim kami orang aceh semoga tetap kuat untuk menghadapi gempuran orang orang ilegal ini dan selalu diberikan kesabaran dan jangan emosi untuk orang rohingya jangan coba coba kalian datang ke indonesia kalian belum tau kalau rakyat indonesia marah yaa,1
as an indonesia were very displeased and disturbed with rohingya refugees despite our attempt of giving them food and shelter they throw them out to the sea and complaining about the food,5

this is not a burmese problem it is not a british problem and it is only an indonesian problem and a malaysian problem in as much as they follow the same religion it is an islamic problem the rohingya never bothered to learn burmese or any of the other indigenous languages of myanmar they never integrated with the country and they persistently agitated for an islamic state in rakhine state which is clearly unacceptable to the majority therebrbr furthermore they have failed to practice birth control in the camps which is why they are so overcrowded several hundred thousand rohingya were born in the camps brbrtheir language is closely related to the chittagong language in bangladesh and they are culturally similar to bangladeshis one of the very few things that most of the warring factions in myanmar agree in is that they agree with the removal of the rohingyathe only two viable options are that they are integated into bangladeshi society with financial support from the islamic world or they are relocated to islamic countries,6
ngapain kayak gini enakan nyamar jadi pengungsi seperti orang bangladesh yang miskin moral serta miskin senyum modal naik perahu tanpa identitas di kasih tempat tinggal gratis makan kali sehari uang bulanan juta tanpa kerja bahkan kabarnya mau dikasih pulaubrwalaupun makanan nya ga cukup tapi emang dia rakus üòÇ,1

let me remind people here indonesia never take part in un convention about refugees and has no part in protocol brso indonesia is not obligated to shelter them these people however the rohingya that recently came to aceh is not refugees from myanmar these people is the victim of human trafficking and not stranded here they are planned to be trafficked to indonesia they are illegal imigrants from the shelter in bangladesh un you take back this people brbreven if indonesian or malaysian start to butcher them there is no law can justify this two countries they are illegal immigrant and not grateful for what the people of indonesia have done for them ‚Ä¶,6
the rohingya ethnicity often throws tantrums they do not know to be grateful food donated by residents is thrown away many protest that the food given is small even though acehnese themselves live in poverty and hunger there have been cases of rohingya youth raping their rohingya girls in exile they often run away from censorship naturally acehnese people are afraid because they are afraid of increasing crime in aceh,5
it should be explained that aceh at first was very accepting of the rohingya ethnicity but after they accepted well the attitude of the rohingya ethnicity they didnt even know thank you and did not respect the locals they often threw tantrums they arbitrarily threw away the food given they complained that the food given to the rohingya ethnicity was very decent and luxurious for us acehnese people even though many acehnese live poorly and starving,5
we dont want indonesia face the same thing like palestine in the future,5

we reject the rohingya not because of human rights issues racial or religious differences but because their behavior is very bad they threw away aid damaged camps polluted fish ponds dumped samoah carelessly slandered harassed volunteers even though we have prioritized helping them over our relatives we provide houses allowances free electricity free water free education free health care when many of our relatives are still in need rohingya are cowards who ran away from the battlefield they have no patriotism and they are never grateful these are the facts the world needs to know,5

they are not refugee but imigran they even pay from banglades camp to indonesia by boat they have cellphone and unhcr card from banglades so we need send back them to where they came from in indonesia their behavior is not good we provided food aid but they threw them into the sea because we didnt allow them to go ashore and when we accommodated them they protested about the portions of food they were given even though the portions were the same as indonesian people eat they also commit criminal acts in aceh such as stealing raping and so on and there are many more bad behaviors of rohingya in aceh so that aceh is already at the limit of patience and doesnt want to accept them anymore,5

bukan hanya warga aceh kami seluruh rakyat indonesia menolak keras imigran gelap rohingnya ini bukan tentang kemanusiaan tapi tentang kedaulatan indonesia mereka bukan datang sebagai pengungsi tapi tinggal selamanya di indonesia tolak dan usir rohingnya,1
they probably thought indonesia is the country that would give them asylum but we actually never ratified any of agreement regarding to refugee with unhcr we just temporarily accept them before unhcr settled them in the country that receive them,3
as a malaysian i truly understand the indonesian we have rohingya refugeesvery problematic people,6
they are not refuges they are illegal imigran even if they are refuges they should be verified first from unhcr they are not verified and enter our country illegally they are not even from myanmar they pay each person to the people smugling syndicate to help them enter indonesia,4
rohingya have bad attitude,6
al jazeera can only report on those that are visible and receive lowquality gossip rohingya were accepted in but they made a lot of chaos that caused conflict among acehnese people as in malaysia rohingya only made chaos after chaos even to the point of asking for land we indonesians do not want something like what happened in our brother country malaysia to be repeated here brrohingya also come not as refugees victims of war but they come as illegal immigrants with human trafficking intermediaries whose profits reach billion rupiah in this shipment brmany rohingya are fleeing in shelters as they await their final journey to malaysia and singapore brtry to gather the real news instead of just collecting cheap gossips among you to lead international public opinion in the wrong direction,6
indonesia is a better place for them to live dont come to malaysia plz,6
ini bukan pengungsi tapi imigran gelap yang suka buang sampah berak sembaranganorangnya susah diaturpemalasberanak banyak tapi tidak memikirkan masa depan anaknya amp agama cuma dipakai kedok untuk memuluskan pindahnya,1
we can not accept the refugees anymore they should go backt to myanmar our duty is to push myanmar goverment to accept them again if they dont want to uno must send un soldier troop to protect them in myanmar that is the best solution,4
they might be another israel in someone‚Äôs land fact those people already make the local angry they welcomed them at first but they can‚Äôt integrate with the local throw the food they have and did violence rape and stealing so what uncr wants now they are more like bangladesh i think it‚Äôs more suitable for them rather than indonesia,5
for those of you who corner indonesia please bring rohingya refugees home to your country indonesia has never ratified the un convention on refugees we have no obligation to accept and accommodate them and for indonesian citizens who want to accept the rohingya please accept them but not in indonesia there are still many poor indonesians who need attention üò†,3

in the meantime affluent individuals in the uk are expelling asylum seekers from their countries see bbc news today indonesia has rejected them because many asylum seekers attempted to reach third countries and were promised assistance by unhcr many of them remain in indonesia after more than years furthermore we have not ratified the convention unlike uk unhcr has merely pressured us to accept them providing us with minimal financial support in fact a unhcr representative mentioned that rohingya children had gone without food for hours however here in indonesia we still grapple with issues of malnourished children some of them have not had a meal in over a day,3
this phenomenon is a form of human trafficking because there is a smuggling agent behind it,0

indonesia in this current state simply cannot afford to accept them or any refugees from any countries indonesia is not a member of un refugee convention and we werent a member for a clear reason thus making us not responsible for their well being yet somehow every month there will be hundreds if not thousands of them coming to our islands we are not a rich country yes we do have a trillion gdp but we also have a tons of people millions of people to be precise that the government must feed and take care among those millions more than of them are still living under national poverty line it isnt fair that those immigrants comes to our land and expecting to be fed and taken care by our government yet there are still millions of natural born indonesians that cant eat cant have a proper house and cant have a sustaining job millions it was earlier this year when we finally able to become an upper middle income country it was just yesterday we finally had our own universal healthcare we are still struggling america europe japan and the other g members were all rich and they are also a member of the convention australia is also one of them go there not here it isnt that we do not want them here it is just that we simply cant afford them if they come years from now when we become a high income nation than be my guest or even be my neighbor but now with the current conditions we cant handle them go to malaysia theyre richer than us their gdp per capita is significantly higher than us they have a lot of bangladeshi people reside over there and theyre also a muslim majority country with significantly lesser population in malaysia compared to indonesia i think they can handle rohingya way better than us,4

they are the people who want to take the whole myanmar as their land not just a piece of land not just rakhine state and the same to whole asia in fact they are all from bangladesh their ethnic and background are bangladesh cannot control the populations because the biggest problem is that their birth rates are very high their government cannot control it if they want to stay in power over crowded there then they created the name rohingya some crossed border and stayed inside myanmar some were back to camp later during incidents and some in camp they have been to myanmar because un feed them and pay them in bangladesh camp but whole bangladeshs country birth rate is very high everything and they take name as from myanmar just blame to myanmar as they are native and they will go to better countries if million of those bengalis live in indonesia then they will claim that land is their same like they claim whole rakhine state of myanmar as theirs they never enough by giving lands to them if they got whole myanmar they will claim again thailand as theirs as well if they do birth controls and dont make troubles in any land they live then they would be ok in bangladesh and other countries but they dont they can be danger to local even in myanmar have you even seem how myanmar people look alike myanmarese are just like indonesian people just like asians but those bengalis are totally different they are absolutely from bangladesh ethnic language culture and behavior all the same there are over million bengalis still living in rakhine and other states in myanmar go see for yourself there they are not in danger by state in myanmar but the are the danger to others just about to any ethnics if not their kind already over millions population in bangladesh alone and million in myanmar alone and population is still keep booming most of them cannot even speak burmese and they dont know the places well about myanmar because they have never been to there in myanmar every can speak burmese no matter whatever the ethnic they may be this thing cant just blame to myanmar because they want to dominate the bigger land as they can in whole asia as per their population grow they cant just live peacefully along with any other different ethnics regardless of the religious look at what had happened in malaysia actual pressure main source should put to bangladesh gov who let them ride boat and allow to have over crowded population if just blame to myanmar that problem will not stop and they will keep on coming because land spaces in bangladesh becomes smaller as they grow more unlimited even if give them whole myanmar they will make massive population again and they still will still keep on coming what they really want is invasion and better lives many of them have more than one wives regardless of their budgets they will make a lot of children without thinking whether can they support them main source of problems are bangladesh birth rate and creation of rohingya to claim as from myanmar if they think myanmar is not safe then they wont even live there but they do live so many of them some cities like pyay meiktila they are nd major populations next to burmese even more than other ethnics they will keep coming many of them never stop they will never stop population grow and they will give their burdens to asia,5

one of the first steps in trying to help the rohingyans plight is by distributing contraceptives and educating them about proper condom usage etc so that they dont overreproduce and overrun refugee camps which are trying to help them,5
why are they still in the sea havent they been accommodated in several countries its a bit strange to see are they fleeing in the country that accommodates them,3

the locals of indonesia will surely cry for taking this refugees in crimes will increase to a big lvlrapes theft n murder rohingyas are no india is already suffering population control should be implied on them because a single man mostly marry women n atleast kids by each women sometimesor else be ready to face consequences,4
one thing to understand is this indonesia is not a signatory country of the unhcr convention on refugees i repeat indonesia is not signatory country yes i know the situations is bad for them in their home but we dont need extra people to feed our country has becomes a destination not just for rohingya people but also for afghans syrians sudanese iranians and just recently russians and ukrainians we cant afford those people as much as i regret what was happening in their home i felt that we should starts limits those refugees there are millions of indonesians who are trying to survive with all of those illegal immigrants coming to indonesia not only that they robed the opportunity for the indonesians to have jobs but also facing us with the threat that they brought often so criminal actions so please i pledge to the government to stop those people coming we dont hate them but we should also prioritize our people first if indonesians already rich and well off then we can helps the other but now it is not the perfect time to do that,6
unhcr must build a refugee complex somewhere in andaman island maybe in sentinel island,4
and after living in indonesia for so many years they would easily tell people that the indonesian government has not given them enough opportunity enough food enough shelter and what not thats what they did with bangladesh bangladeshi government and bangladeshi people did and are doing everything they could possibly do for them they lived in bangladesh for more than years thousands of volunteers and ngos are in bangladesh and they are so ungrateful its understandable if they went to indonesia but at least no need for harsh wordsbrgreat disappointment,6

malaysian sometimes too kind until they not follow our rule and our law after taking care of them then but there many issues related to them if the rohingya refugees want to go to our country they should follow our law taking care thier cleanliness dont do crime dont make malaysian community uncomfortable because thier attitude they also should know about birth control management too too many rohingya community but they cant taking care themselves until cause other problems respect other as you want to be respected dont try to claim to have your own places or territory in our country because we cant handle it our attitude personality and behavior too different and too hard to relate it we as islamic community respect and accept them but if the laws courtesy rules attitude and behavior of them not respect and blend with or community it will issues and problem in our country,6
