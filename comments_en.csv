They came illegally more and more  brought by UNHCR backed up by Amnesty international through their minions inside and outside Indonesia. No country will accept this rebellious people. Neither ours. Indonesia is a sovereign country. Our country our sovereignity!! We reject Rohinya. Neither welcome nor give em any single piece of our land for them! Never ever!!

@KittyJungleIndonesia,2023-12-16T10:38:20Z,2023-12-16T10:38:20Z,1,"We would like to clarify that based on the Republic of Indonesia Presidential Decree Reg No. 125 Concerning Handling of Refugees From Overseas as well as Immigration Law No. 6 of 2011 Article 8 Paragraph 1, Article 9 Paragraphs 1 and 2, Rohingya arrival and its method of arrival falls under the category of illegal immigrants and not refugees until proven otherwise. Simply put they aren&#39;t under chase, etc unlike what had happened to them in the past. And FYI, Indonesia did not sign the ratification of the 1951 Refugee Convention so under international law so we have every right to refuse their arrival. Especially in recent cases they have been linked to an alleged people smuggling and human trafficking network (recently there have been arrests regarding this). They first arrived in 2011 then in 2015 they reportedly started causing serious security problems such as escaping from shelters in Aceh, etc. As well as in the communities where they live in Indonesia and Malaysia because many of them were and are adult men. And economically we simply can&#39;t afford it. At the very least please interview both sides and not only UNHCR&#39;s Emily Bojovic, but also an Indonesian expert on this phenomenon before publishing it to millions of viewers, thank you. On one of their recent arrivals in Aceh, the people on the boat threw food given by local residents into the sea because the local rejected their arrival (rightfully so). Personally, that doesn&#39;t sounds like what a refugee would do.."

These are all categorized under illegal immigrants. Of course, as immigrants should not enter an area without clear data such as passports or visas, so Rohingya are precisely referred to as illegal immigrants. On the other hand, with Palestine or Afghanistan, they are in a state of war raging. Please understand before creating a title so that your channel is not considered a channel that has no understanding in this matter."

It is an Islamic problem. The Rohingya never bothered to learn Burmese or any of the other indigenous languages of Myanmar, they never integrated with the country and they persistently agitated for an islamic state in Rakhine state which is clearly unacceptable to the majority there.<br><br> Furthermore they have failed to practice birth control in the camps which is why they are so overcrowded. Several hundred thousand Rohingya were BORN in the camps. <br><br>Their language is closely related to the Chittagong language in Bangladesh and they are culturally similar to Bangladeshis. One of the very few things that most of the warring factions in Myanmar agree in is that they agree with the removal of the Rohingya.The only two viable options are that they are integated into Bangladeshi society with financial support from the Islamic world or they are relocated to Islamic countries."

Indonesia has rejected them because many asylum seekers attempted to reach third countries and were promised assistance by UNHCR. Many of them remain (15,000) in Indonesia after more than 10 years. Furthermore, we have not ratified the 1951 convention (unlike UK). UNHCR has merely pressured us to accept them, providing us with minimal financial support. In fact, a UNHCR representative mentioned that Rohingya children had gone without food for 8 hours. However, here in Indonesia, we still grapple with issues of malnourished children.

Indonesia is not a member of UN refugee convention and we weren&#39;t a member for a clear reason. Thus making us not responsible for their well being, yet somehow every month there will be hundreds if not thousands of them coming to our islands. We are not a rich country. Yes, we do have a trillion gdp but we also have a tons of people, 270 millions of people to be precise that the government must feed and take care. Among those 270 millions, more than 9% of them are still living under national poverty line. It isn&#39;t fair that those immigrants comes to our land and expecting to be fed and taken care by our government yet there are still millions of natural born indonesians that can&#39;t eat, can&#39;t have a proper house and can&#39;t have a sustaining job. Millions. It was earlier this year when we finally able to become an upper middle income country, it was just yesterday we finally had our own universal healthcare. We are still struggling. America, europe, japan, and the other g7 members were all rich and they are also a member of the convention. Australia is also one of them. Go there, not here. It isn&#39;t that we do not want them here, it is just that we simply can&#39;t afford them. If they come 20/30 years from now when we become a high income nation than be my guest or even be my neighbor. But now, with the current conditions, we can&#39;t handle them. Go to malaysia, they&#39;re richer than us, their gdp per capita is significantly higher than us, they have a lot of bangladeshi people reside over there, and they&#39;re also a muslim majority country. With significantly lesser population in malaysia compared to indonesia, i think they can handle rohingya way better than us."

If million of those  Bengalis live in Indonesia then they will claim that land is their same like they claim whole Rakhine State of Myanmar as theirs, they never enough by giving lands to them, if they got whole Myanmar they will claim again Thailand as theirs as well. If they do birth controls and don&#39;t make troubles in any land they live then they would be ok in Bangladesh and other countries but they don&#39;t, they can be danger to local even in Myanmar. Have you even seem how Myanmar people look alike? Myanmarese are just like Indonesian people, just like Asians but those Bengalis are totally different they are absolutely from Bangladesh, ethnic, language, culture and behavior all the same , there are over 1 million Bengalis still living in Rakhine and other States in Myanmar, go see for yourself there, they are not in danger by State in Myanmar but the are the danger to others just about to any ethnics if not their kind. Already over 160 millions population in Bangladesh alone and million in Myanmar alone and population is still keep booming, most of them cannot even speak Burmese and they don&#39;t know the places well about Myanmar because they have never been to there, in Myanmar every can speak Burmese no matter whatever the ethnic they may be. This thing can&#39;t just blame to Myanmar because they want to dominate the bigger land as they can in whole Asia as per their population grow, they can&#39;t just live peacefully along with any other different ethnics regardless of the religious, look at what had happened in Malaysia. Actual pressure main source should put to    Bangladesh Gov who let them ride boat and allow to have over crowded population, if just blame to Myanmar that problem will not stop and they will keep on coming because land spaces in Bangladesh becomes smaller as they grow more unlimited. Even if give them whole Myanmar they will make massive population again and they still will still keep on coming, what they really want is invasion and better lives. Many of them have more than one wives, regardless of their budgets they will make a lot of children without thinking whether can they support them, main source of problems are Bangladesh, Birth Rate and creation of Rohingya to claim as from Myanmar, if they think Myanmar is not safe then they won&#39;t even live there but they do, live so many of them, some cities like Pyay, Meiktila they are 2nd major populations next to Burmese even more than other ethnics. They will keep coming, many of them, never stop. They will never stop population grow and they will give their burdens to Asia."

@atiati1717,2023-12-15T01:06:46Z,2023-12-15T01:06:46Z,1,"Pemerintah harus tegas, Pemerintah buatkan tempat khusus buat mereka, pinjamkan 1 pulau yang terisolir buat mereka. pulau yang jauh dari penduduk, suruh UNHCR buat bangunan kebutuhan mereka seperti yang ada di pulau Galang termasuk penjara buat imigran gelap Rohingya yang melakukan pelanggaran dan imigran yang hendak kabur, tugaskan polisi dan tentara secara bergantian untuk mengawasi mereka. semua imigran gelap Rohingya dan pengungsi Rohingya serta Bangladesh yang tersebar di beberapa daerah di Indonesia di satukan di pulau tersebut sampai negara mereka aman. Saya rasa itu TDK akan masalah buat mereka, bukankah alasan mereka lari dari myanmar dan Bangladesh karena keamanan, nahhhh dipulau tersebut nanti mereka akan aman. Kecuali mereka punya niat dan tujuan lain  datang ke Indonesia. Dan Pemerintah yang menentukan bukan mengikuti keinginan mereka yang ingin hidup bebas di tengah tengah masyarakat lokal, dan Pemerintah tidak usah mengikuti keinginan UNHCR yg hanya bisa bawa mereka lalu dilepas begitu saja ditengah tengah masyarakat. Biar para etnis Rohingya berfikir ulang lagi kalau mau datang ke Indonesia. Karena sebenarnya kebanyakan mereka yang datang berharap hidup bebas seperti di Malaysia. Kalau misalnya mereka terisolir, mereka dengan sendirinya akan minta dipulangkan ke negaranya dan yang akan ke Indonesia akan berfikir ulang lagi. Pemerintah harus hati2 ingat pernyataan Benyamin Netanyahu PM Israhell Zionis Nazi, setelah makin hebohnya julid fisabilillah yang dipelopori oleh rakyat Indonesia, Israhell pastinya TDK mau diam Netanyahu mengatakan kalau mereka ingin menjadikan Indonesia seperti Palestina dan terbukti kan setelah pernyataannya, para imigran gelap Rohingya dan Bangladesh berdatangan ke Indonesia. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nkrihargamati"">#NKRIhargamati</a><br><br>Semua rakyat Indonesia harus bekerja sama untuk melakukan sweeping, kalau tertangkap bawa mereka ke kantor polisi lalu hubungi UNHCR untuk jemput mereka, jangan kasi hati.

@personarebellia6775,2023-12-15T12:31:01Z,2023-12-15T12:31:01Z,0,"You can&#39;t say Rohingya are refugees, because they came by the method of giving some payment to the human trafficking mafia in Bangladesh. These are all categorized under illegal immigrants. Of course, as immigrants should not enter an area without clear data such as passports or visas, so Rohingya are precisely referred to as illegal immigrants. On the other hand, with Palestine or Afghanistan, they are in a state of war raging. Please understand before creating a title so that your channel is not considered a channel that has no understanding in this matter."

As much as i regret what was happening in their home, i felt that we should starts limits those refugees. There are millions of Indonesians who are trying to survive. With all of those illegal immigrants coming to Indonesia not only that they robed the opportunity for the indonesians to have jobs but also facing us with the threat that they brought often so criminal actions.

That&#39;s what they did with Bangladesh. Bangladeshi Government and Bangladeshi people did and are doing everything they could possibly do for them. They lived in Bangladesh for more than 20 years, thousands of volunteers and NGOs are in Bangladesh !! And they are so ungrateful. It&#39;s understandable if they went to Indonesia but at least no need for harsh words.<br>Great disappointment."

Because everyone knew that Rohingya was a problem created by the British when Burma was a British colony. The British like to use minority as civil servants so that these minority will not revolt against the British Colonial rule. The British use Tamils in Sri Lanka. End up creating Tamil Tiger Insurgents after Sri Lanka independence. The British use Rohingya  in Burma so end up creating Rohingya  insurgents in Burma after the country gain independence. Nobody want to clear up the mess created by the British.

@d3n1.s,2023-12-14T03:19:24Z,2023-12-14T03:19:24Z,0,their number is more than 2000. they are illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. why not take them to your country. Do you know what their nature is like in Malaysia? the intimidation of Bangladeshis and Rohinians against us natives. usurp and confiscate our land.<br>UNHCR Bangladesh is a group that sells humans to be sent to Indonesia. You are a mafia by promising Rohinians and Bangladeshis that you will live in luxury and be facilitated by everyone in Indonesia. Are you sure? In our country there are still many who are poor and need help. Go away from our country
@user-lh7yv2os6n,2023-12-14T02:39:15Z,2023-12-14T02:39:15Z,0,What I hate most about the media is capitalizing on the children and babies. They&#39;re illegal immigrants. It&#39;s their parents&#39; fault to bring them on the boat and become illegal immigrants. It&#39;s not Indonesia&#39;s fault that they&#39;re having such a fate now. Guests stay a few days and left. Not long-term. Long-term is called kos-kos or hotel. You register and pay for it and are still subject to landlord&#39;s and hotel&#39;s rules. Just leave and stay at the house of those people who comment that Indonesia is not doing enough.

Can&#39;t you at least have residents adopt the children. But no parent would want to leave their child. If there was a way to create a eco-friendly manmanlde island that would help. With that it adds space for homes to be built. The houses would have to be very close though. Or ones responsible for racism should be jailed. None should fear the people they live with.

Myanmar is a country with official 135 ethnic groups and Rohingya is nothing like them. Just look at us. They are literally Bengalis who were leaked from Bangladesh to our western border. There is nothing Myanmar can do for these illegal immigrants. Every nation has their own rules and regulations and Myanmar have too. Only thing Myanmar can do is letting them out to reach wherever they wanna go. Those Rohingyas are also humans and so they definitely know where they belong to.

And now when the situation eased on them, they started harbouring ttp terrorists,  smuggling across our boarders and started committing mass crimes in our countries.  We even let them own land in our country as refugees, no country does that with refugees.  The south asian country would be very misguided to accept them"
